Everyone is coming to my place for repairs but my todo list is pretty full, so why don't you just go to Gormsson Habitat and look for the repairs you need?

It would be too complicated to explain now. And GALAL are genetically altered algae, which are farmed and harvested for their polysaccharid polymers.

There has been a recent docking accident wich a capsized dutch carrier that eventually sank directly in sight of this station before anyone could send a recovery crew. If you can salvage both of their batteries there should be enough material for your repairs and enough for me to stock up my workshop.\n\nI can borrow you a spare low-capacity battery, but don't go too far, you don't want to end like that carrier.","o":[{"a":"Hmmmm ...","next":"New 11"}],"editor":{"position":{"x":914.875,"y":120.75}}},"New 15":{"q":"Some old vanished upworld civilisation.
