You are broken.
After making severeal financial losses in your business with developing a
new generation of enhanced nuclear reactors you stay left near bankrupcy. Your business
partners have already disappeared and your clients demand
their credits back. Well, those 1.7 million won't gain from nowhere and
your backup accounts were already seized. Before the authorities of
the Clans Union would accuse you of fraudulent activities it's better to disappear
for a while. Using jump ships
would cause a lot of beaurocratic trouble so you make your way and bribe
some freighter captain. After spending days in a dirty cabin and ear pinching humming
noise of the main engine you make it to the cold waters of the Barents Sea.

An old cockle boat is all you get to make the rest of your way on your own. At
least you have enough oxygen in your tanks to reach your destination:
Lagertha Electrolyte Research Base.

      			> "Oohkay, oohkay. Not me trying to help a stranger."
      				:: "Bye."
      					> "One hint, but just because I'm nice even to mud eels like you. Your 'ship' definiety needs some fixing. Ask Luka over there. They will fix even a broken tin can."

  > Light, stranger.
    :: Light, Luka.
      > Hey, do we know each other?
        :: Yannick told me you could help me with some technical issues on my ship.
          > Yannick surely told you. He tells everyone, so why don't you just go to Gormsson Habitat and look for the repairs you need? They are usually well eqipped and reasonably cheap.
            :: I am very sorry to say I can't. I was on my way to Lagertha Base when my battery died. Can you please help me?
              > !!!
            :: Gormsson is currently out of reach for me.
              > Well, then. Why don't you ask Lying Pete for help? He didn't not help me in all situations – not.
                :: Haha, you are making fun of me.
                  > Noooo. Never. Go talk to Lying Pete. He's dutch, by the way.
                    :: What's dutch?
                      > Some old upworld cult. People say the dutch had the power to subdue the ocean.
    :: Good evening, Luka.
      > Evening? Sneel. I just got up. How comes you think it's evening? Mother's system time is available to everyone. Feel free to synchronize your RIG time on our network anytime you want, it's free.

    :: Hello.
      > Ah, an introvert. You seem to be a new arrival, I saw you talking to Yannick. No one sane talks with Yannick. Welcome to the station.
